# MICE Gauge

In [this lecture and workshop from Mary Robinette Kowal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blehVIDyuXk), we learn an interesting equation for target story length based on the number of characters, stages, and "MICE" threads.  

This quick progressive web app provides sliders for these factors and estimates a target story length.
